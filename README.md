# Go-Tour

The exercises from my [Go Language Tour](https://go.dev/tour/) after
I first took it in beginning of August, 2014 and then kept refreshing
my knowledge whenever necessary.

# Usage

To build the exercises do the following:

 1. Clone the repository (e.g. in your home directory):

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gdsotirov/go-tour.git
cd go-tour
```

 2. Build all exercises:

```
make --jobs
```

 3. Run exercises (e.g. `ex_mtp_23_wc`):

```
./ex_mtp_23_wc
```
